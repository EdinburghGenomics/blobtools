This version has been patched to implement the --sort_first option. I've contributed
the patch back to blobtools upstream.

Use 'git diff' to see what I changed.

On 6/12/18 I also fixed a bug where with a very low number of alignments the progress
function would crash. It seems the rest of the report making is fine.

On 19/7/18 I added a way to scale the Y axis from 0 to 1
